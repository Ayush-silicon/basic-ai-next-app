## 💡 Usage / How It Works
This application provides a minimal interface to interact with an AI model, demonstrating real-time streaming of responses. Once the application is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Enter your query into the input field and press Enter or click the submit button. The AI's response will stream directly to the interface as it's generated, showcasing the power of server-sent events or similar streaming mechanisms for a highly responsive user experience.
